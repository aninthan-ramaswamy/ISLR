##Introduction to Statistical Learning

This is my github repository that includes all the concepts and content I have covered while going through what is probably the best beginner level book for statistical data mining - [Introduction to Statistical Learning with applications in R](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/)

What I have tried to do here is to capture the video lectures and R labs for the various concepts, that were offered as part of the course work on stanford.lagunita.org. I try to update this as frequently as possible with code and exercise changes, based on what I have learnt.

Following are the links to the individual notebooks -
