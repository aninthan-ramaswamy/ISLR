## Introduction to Statistical Learning

This is my github repository that includes all the concepts and content I have covered while going through what is probably the best beginner level book for statistical data mining - [Introduction to Statistical Learning with applications in R](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/)

What I have tried to do here is to capture the video lectures and R labs for the various concepts, that were offered as part of the course work on stanford.lagunita.org. I try to update this as frequently as possible with code and exercise changes, based on what I have learnt.

Following are the links to the individual notebooks - 

1. [Classification](https://aninthan-ramaswamy.github.io/ISLR-Training/Labs/Classification_ISLR.nb.html)
2. [Resampling](https://aninthan-ramaswamy.github.io/ISLR-Training/Labs/Resampling_ISLR.nb.html)
3. [Non-Linear Models](https://aninthan-ramaswamy.github.io/ISLR-Training/Labs/Non_Linear_Models_ISLR.nb.html)
4. [Support Vector Machines](https://aninthan-ramaswamy.github.io/ISLR-Training/Labs/SVM_ISLR.nb.html)
5. [Tree Based Models](https://aninthan-ramaswamy.github.io/ISLR-Training/Labs/Tree_Based_Models_ISLR.nb.html)
6. [Unsupervised Learning](https://aninthan-ramaswamy.github.io/ISLR-Training/Labs/Unsupervised_Learning_ISLR.nb.html)

Do reach out if there are any clarifications or suggestions!
