```{r}
rm(list = ls())

```{r}
setwd("E:/Academia/Additional/Statistical Learning - Lagunita Stanford/R Codes")
load("7.R.rdata")
```

Load the data from the file 7.R.RData, and plot it using plot(x,y). What is the slope coefficient in a linear regression of y on x (to within 10%)?
```{r}
plot(x,y)
```

```{r}
summary(lm(y~x))
```


```{r}
lm(y ~ 1+x+I(x^2))
```

Despite the fact that the overall slope is slightly negative, the linear term is very positive.

Because the values of x are far from zero, a large linear term is needed to offset the quadratic term; otherwise the slope would be very negative in the range of the data. This is why we usually do not interpret the lower-order terms in a polynomial regression.
